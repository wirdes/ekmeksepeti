# Ekmek Sepeti
I have made a food ordering system. It will help the restaurant to do all the functionalities more accurately and in a faster way and to maintain records, as many restaurants do that in a manual way. Users will register and log in to the system then place an order from the menu of the restaurant the app will manage all the processes of taking the order, payment, and process the order. Users can also view order history and edit their profile details.
